# FinalDodge
Added health to the character, which loses health every time it touches the mod. Apples will randomly appear on the map, and one point will be added if you pick them up. Pressing the space key will give the player a protective cover against damage from mods, but they will not be able to pick up apples, and the protective cover has a ten-second cooldown
